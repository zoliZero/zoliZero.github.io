</p><br><p>When it comes to product development, safety is always the number one priority. This is especially true when it comes to batteries, as a faulty battery can be extremely dangerous. That's why battery testing is such an important step in the development process. It's also useful to know about battery testing if you are an engineer.</p>
<p>In this guide, we will discuss battery standards and how to test a battery using industry standards. We'll also take a look at some of the most common tests for batteries used in electric vehicles.</p>
<p>Is your team developing a new car battery? Do you want to make sure your current battery product is safe? This guide will help you understand everything you need to know about battery testing!</p>
<h2>Battery Standards vs Battery Regulations</h2>
<p>Here at Labshare, we connect product manufacturers and testing laboratories. That way we can make testing much easier.</p>
<p>Are you considering <a title="https://thelabshare.com/#CONTACT" href="https://thelabshare.com/#CONTACT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">choosing our services</a> or deciding to test in-house? Either way, here's a guide to battery standards and regulations.</p>
<p>To understand battery standards and testing, you must first know the difference between a standard and a regulation.</p>
<p>Industry professionals consider devices safe or acceptable when they conform to a standard. However, standards don't dictate how manufacturers should make products. They also don't regulate them at all!</p>
<p>The purpose of a standard is to allow manufacturers a certain degree of flexibility when designing their products.</p>
<p>A regulation is a law that manufacturers must follow. This means that products must meet specific requirements for businesses to sell them legally. Battery regulations are in place to ensure the safety of battery users.</p>
<p>There are several different battery standards, which we will discuss below.</p>
<h2>Battery Standards for Electric Vehicles</h2>
<p>In the automotive industry, some standards and regulations apply to the batteries <a title="https://www.eba250.com/about-eba250/?cn-reloaded=1" href="https://www.eba250.com/about-eba250/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used in electric vehicles</a> (EV). There are also some for other components like charging systems or electrical wiring harnesses.</p>
<p>Some of these are safety-related and others focus on performance characteristics. For example expected voltage output capacity at low temperature, charging time, or cycle life. </p>
<p>The most important battery standard for electric vehicles is UN 38.3. This document sets out the safety requirements for lithium-ion batteries. It's for use in transport applications. It covers everything from manufacturing to handling, testing, and packaging of these batteries.</p>
<p>UN 38.3 has changed a few times over the years. <a title="https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/danger/ST_SG_AC.10_11_Rev6_E_WEB_-With_corrections_from_Corr.1.pdf" href="https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/danger/ST_SG_AC.10_11_Rev6_E_WEB_-With_corrections_from_Corr.1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The latest version</a> includes new provisions for battery cells and pack assemblies, as well as guidelines for safe transport by air.</p>
<p>In addition to UN 38.3, there are a few other standards that are relevant to EV batteries: </p>
<ul><li><a title="https://www.iso.org/standard/51414.html" href="https://www.iso.org/standard/51414.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ISO 12405-1</a> (<a title="https://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62660-1%7Bed2.0.RLV%7Den.pdf" href="https://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec62660-1%7Bed2.0.RLV%7Den.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEC 62660-1</a>) series covers testing of lithium-ion cells and batteries</li>
<li><a title="https://unece.org/DAM/trans/doc/2009/wp29grsp/GRSP-45-28e.pdf" href="https://unece.org/DAM/trans/doc/2009/wp29grsp/GRSP-45-28e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ECE R100</a> is a European standard for electric vehicles that includes requirements for battery chargers</li>
</ul><p>Each of these standards has its own specific requirements, so it's important to be aware of them when developing or testing EV batteries. </p>
<p>There's also a searchable database of <a title="https://batterystandards.info/" href="https://batterystandards.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 400 battery standards</a> available. </p>
<h2>Battery Testing Procedures </h2>
<p>Now that we've covered the different <a title="https://www.eurobat.org/" href="https://www.eurobat.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EUROBAT endorsed</a> European battery standards, let's take a look at how to test batteries.</p>
<p>Testing teams can perform two types of tests on EV batteries, destructive and non-destructive. These terms refer to whether or not they will destroy your battery for the test to work properly (which means you'll need another one).</p>
<h3>Destructive Testing </h3>
<p>Destructive testing is the most common type of battery test. It involves simulating real-world conditions to measure a battery's performance. This can include things like charging and discharging at different voltages. It could also mean exposing them to extreme temperatures for example. It can mean putting them through a lot of cycles and counting how many until they break.</p>
<h2>Non-Destructive Testing </h2>
<p>Non-destructive testing, on the other hand, does not destroy your battery. Instead, it analyzes its characteristics by measuring things like voltage output capacity at low temperature or charging time. </p>
<p>There are also many different types of tests that you can perform on batteries. Here are some of the most common ones:</p>
<ul><li>Charging/discharging under high load conditions (e.g. 100% discharge or charge)</li>
<li>Cycling (repeatedly charging and discharging a battery)</li>
<li>Temperature testing ( exposing batteries to different temperatures)</li>
<li>Capacity testing (measuring the amount of energy a battery can store)</li>
<li>Voltage sag test (testing how much voltage a battery will lose when subjected to a high current load)</li>
<li>Internal resistance test (checking the electrical resistance of a battery's cells)</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, there are many different ways to test batteries. Which tests you need to perform will depend on your specific application and requirements.</p>
<h2>Testing An Electric Vehicle Battery</h2>
<p>Now that we've covered battery standards and testing procedures, let's take a look at how to test an electric vehicle battery.</p>
<p>The first step is to identify the battery type. You can do this by looking at the label on the battery or checking the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>Here are a few common types of EV batteries. </p>
<h3>Lead-Acid </h3>
<p>A lead-acid battery is the oldest type of rechargeable battery and has been in production since 1859. It consists of two plates made from lead, each surrounded by an electrolyte solution (usually sulfuric acid).</p>
<p>When a charge passes through these plates, it causes one of them to dissolve while another plate forms on top of the other one. The lead plates are then used as electrodes. They generate electricity via electro-chemical reactions between them and their surrounding electrolyte solution. </p>
<h3>Lithium-Ion</h3>
<p>A lithium-ion battery is a rechargeable cell that uses a chemical reaction to store energy. It consists of two electrodes (an anode and cathode), each made from a different material, and a separator in between them. </p>
<p>The lithium-ion battery gets its name from the type of ions that are transported between electrodes during charging and discharging.</p>
<h3>Nickel-Metal Hydride </h3>
<p>A nickel-metal hydride battery is a rechargeable battery. It uses nickel oxide hydroxide as its positive electrode. It has a hydrogen storage alloy as its negative electrode. It was first developed in the early 1970s and is a popular choice for portable electronics devices.</p>
<h2>Selecting The Appropriate Test Procedure For Battery Type</h2>
<p>Once you've identified the battery type, you can select the appropriate test procedure.</p>
<p>The most common tests that are performed on lead-acid batteries are cycling, capacity testing, and voltage sag testing.</p>
<p>For lithium-ion batteries, the most common tests are cycling and charge/discharge testing under high load conditions.</p>
<h2>Definitions of Cycling, Capacity Testing, and Voltage Sag Testing </h2>
<p>Are some of these words new to you? No problem, we'll explain each of them right now.</p>
<h3>Cycling Test Methods </h3>
<p>Cycling means repeatedly charging and discharging a battery. There are three main types of cycling tests.</p>
<p>The first type is the constant current discharge test, which is used to measure a battery's capacity. </p>
<p>The second type is the constant power load test, which is used to measure a battery's voltage stability under high loads. The third type is the stepped discharge test, which is used to measure a battery's discharge rate at different load levels.</p>
<h3>Capacity Testing Methods</h3>
<p>The capacity test measures the amount of energy that can be stored in a battery during one charge/discharge cycle. There are two main types of capacity tests. </p>
<p>The first type is the full-capacity test, which measures the total capacity of a battery. The second type is the partial-capacity test, which measures how much energy a battery can store at different load levels.</p>
<h2>Voltage Sag Testing Methods</h2>
<p>The voltage sag test checks how much voltage a battery will lose when subjected to high currents and/or low temperatures. There are three main types of voltage sag tests. </p>
<p>The first type is the stepped discharge test, which measures how much energy a battery can store under different load levels. </p>
<p>The second type is the constant power load test. This test measures how much energy a battery loses over time.</p>
<p>It analyses different loads and temperatures. The third type is the pulse discharge test. this test checks whether or not a battery will experience voltage drops when subjected to high currents.</p>
<h2>Performing Non-Destructive Tests</h2>
<p>Most of the time engineers would prefer to do a non-destructive test that resulted in usable battery data.</p>
<p>Non-destructive tests are cheaper, easier, and less time-consuming than destructive tests. However, non-destructive tests do not always yield accurate results. This is because they're based on assumptions about the device's internal structure. Sometimes they're based on perceived performance characteristics.</p>
<p>The key equipment you will need to perform non-destructive tests on batteries should include:</p>
<ul><li>A multimeter</li>
<li>A capacitance meter</li>
<li>An impedance analyzer</li>
<li>Calibrated ammeter <a title="https://www.britannica.com/science/voltmeter" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/voltmeter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or voltmeter</a></li>
<li>Temperature chambers/sensors</li>
</ul><p>When performing non-destructive tests on batteries, you can use a voltage meter to check the battery's voltage output. This is done by connecting the positive terminal of <a title="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all" href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your multimeter</a> to one terminal. Then, you can touch both terminals together with another wire (which should be connected back into your multimeter).</p>
<p>If there is no voltage reading between 0 volts DC or 0 volts AC and the battery's terminals, then this means that your battery is discharged. It should not be used.</p>
<p><a title="https://engineering.electrical-equipment.org/others/how-to-use-a-capacitance-meter.html" href="https://engineering.electrical-equipment.org/others/how-to-use-a-capacitance-meter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A capacitance meter</a> can be used to measure the amount of charge a battery can store. This method mirrors tests using a multimeter and some multimeters also have a capacitance meter included.</p>
<p>If there is a reading on the capacitance meter, then this indicates that the battery still has some charge left in it.</p>
<p><a title="https://www.wise-geek.com/what-is-an-impedance-analyzer.htm" href="https://www.wise-geek.com/what-is-an-impedance-analyzer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The impedance analyzer</a> can be used to measure the internal resistance of a battery. This method is also similar to the method for multimeters and capacitance meters.</p>
<p>If there is a reading on the impedance analyzer, then this indicates that the battery still has some resistance left in it.</p>
<p>Capacity testing can also be performed using an ammeter or voltmeter. For this test, you will want to discharge the battery completely by connecting it to a load.</p>
<p>When performing capacity testing, you should always be sure that your ammeter or voltmeter is properly calibrated before beginning any tests. Your test can only be as accurate as your devices.</p>
<p>Once you have completed all of these steps for each battery in your pack, then you can determine the total capacity of your pack. To do this, add up all of the individual capacities for each battery.</p>
<h2>How to Test a Car Battery Outside a Lab Environment</h2>
<p>This article primarily focuses on testing batteries for product development, but if you're developing a car battery product you might want to conduct simple functionality tests outside of <a title="https://thelabshare.com/Remote_Laboratories.html" href="https://thelabshare.com/Remote_Laboratories.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the lab</a>, or even perform roadside tests.</p>
<p>The first step is to connect the voltmeter to the positive and negative terminals of the battery. Make sure that the meter is set to DC voltage measurement.</p>
<p>If you're testing a battery in the engine bay, make sure that the car is turned off and all of the cables are disconnected. Flat battery voltage should be measured with the engine off and all electrical loads disconnected.</p>
<p>The resting voltage of a battery is important to know because it can help you diagnose problems with the battery or charging system. A healthy 12-volt car battery should have a resting voltage of about 12.65 volts when not under load.</p>
<p>From a product development perspective, field tests using swapped out batteries can help teams to optimize a car battery product and provide real usage and product reliability data.</p>
<h2>To Test Other Types Of Battery or Perform Lab Tests </h2>
<p>If it's not a car battery you want to test or you want to test in a lab environment, keep reading. Next, we'll explore other test methods. </p>
<p>The next step is to connect your battery to a test rig that can perform the required tests. This may include things like temperature chambers, environmental chambers, or other specialized equipment. It depends on what type of test you're performing.</p>
<p>The test rig will then run the battery through its paces by charging and discharging it at different voltages. This exposes it to extreme temperatures or puts it through a number of cycles.</p>
<p>Once the test is complete, it's time to interpret the results and see what they mean.</p>
<h2>Testing a Lead-Acid Battery</h2>
<p>If you're testing a lead-acid battery, then check for any signs of sulfation (buildup of lead sulfate) on the plates or around the terminals. If there is some present, but not too much, then this means that your battery is still good.</p>
<p>If there is a lot of sulfation on the plates, then this indicates that your battery has reached the end of its lifespan. It should be replaced with a new one as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So, we've already introduced the concepts earlier for how you can test the lead-acid battery using cycling, capacity testing, and voltage sag testing. Let's go into more detail.</p>
<h3>How To Cycle Test a Lead-Acid Battery </h3>
<p>Here's a step-by-step guide. Start by connecting the positive and negative terminals of your battery to a load tester.</p>
<p>The next step is to set the load tester to a current that's equivalent to 20% of the amp-hour rating of your battery. For example, if you have a 100Ah battery, then set the load tester at 20A.</p>
<p>Now, start the test by slowly increasing the load on the battery until it reaches its maximum voltage. Hold that voltage for a few minutes, and then decrease the load until the battery falls below its starting voltage.</p>
<p>Make sure to record all of your data so you can analyze it later. You'll want to know things like how long it took for your battery to reach its maximum voltage. Check how long it stayed at that voltage level before falling back down again. </p>
<p>You'll also want to know the minimum and maximum voltages achieved by your battery during this test cycle as well.</p>
<p>Once you have all of these numbers recorded, then you can start looking at what they mean. </p>
<p>A good lead-acid battery should be able to reach its maximum voltage within a few minutes of starting the test. Then it should gradually fall back down until it reaches its minimum voltage in about an hour or two after that. So if your battery is at least doing this well, then consider yourself lucky!</p>
<p>On the other hand though, if your battery falls below its minimum voltage before reaching its maximum voltage it's not performing well. It couldn't be used as a reliable power source in any kind of application.</p>
<p>In that case, you could try changing out the electrolyte solution with one that has a higher acid content. This may help improve performance by increasing conductivity between the plates.</p>
<p>Or, if all else fails then it might be time to replace your battery with a new one. There's no way of fixing its terminal problem without disassembling it and replacing each component part by hand (which is very labor-intensive).</p>
<h3>How To Charge/Discharge Test a Lead-Acid Battery Under High Load Conditions </h3>
<p>Start by connecting the positive and negative terminals of your battery to a load tester. Then, set the load tester at 100% capacity (which should be equivalent to one amp).</p>
<p>Now start cycling the battery from 0V up until its maximum voltage level and back down again repeatedly for 30 minutes straight without stopping. </p>
<p>Make sure you're keeping track of how long it takes your battery to reach its maximum voltage as well as when it falls back down below its minimum voltage level. </p>
<p>If your battery is good, then these numbers should be relatively close together in time and shouldn't differ by more than an hour or two at most.</p>
<p>This test is a good way to determine whether or not your battery is capable of still holding a charge properly. So, it's a good test for a battery that has been sitting idle for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Are you finding that it doesn't hold its maximum voltage level as well when it is being discharged under these conditions? Then this could be a sign that there's some sort of problem with one or more components inside the battery itself. </p>
<h3>How To Voltage Sag Test A Lead-Acid Battery</h3>
<p>Voltage Sag testing means measuring the amount of voltage drop over time while under a load. Then compare that with what you see when your battery is being discharged at its maximum capacity.</p>
<p>To do this test all need to do is set up an ammeter between the positive terminal and ground on one side of your battery. Alternatively, just connect it directly to the negative terminal if there isn't any room.</p>
<p>Then connect a voltmeter between the positive and negative terminals on the other side of your battery. That way you can measure its output voltage.</p>
<p>Set both meters to read out in millivolts (mV) rather than volts (V) since this will give you more precise readings when dealing with smaller numbers.</p>
<p>Now start cycling the battery from 0V up until its maximum voltage level and back down again repeatedly for 30 minutes straight without stopping.</p>
<p>Make sure you're keeping track of how long it takes your battery to reach its maximum voltage. Also, note whenever it falls back down below its minimum voltage level. </p>
<p>Once you've finished the test, use the following equation to calculate the voltage sag:</p>
<p>Voltage Sag (mV) = (Maximum Voltage - Minimum Voltage) / Load Current</p>
<p>For example, if your battery reaches a maximum voltage of 12.75V and falls back down to a minimum voltage of 11.50V then the voltage sag would be calculated as follows. </p>
<p>Voltage Sag (mV) = (12.75 - 11.50) / 0.95A</p>
<p>= 125 mv or approximately 0.125 volts</p>
<p>This is the amount of voltage drop over time when your battery is under full load at its maximum capacity for 30 minutes straight without stopping!</p>
<p>Was this number significantly higher than the voltage sag that was measured when your battery was being discharged at its maximum capacity? If so, then you might have a problem on your hands. </p>
<h2>How To Check The State of Charge Of A Lead-Acid Battery </h2>
<p>The easiest way to measure the state of charge (SOC) of a lead-acid battery is by using a hydrometer.</p>
<p><a title="https://www.grainger.com/know-how/equipment-information/kh-product-guide-how-to-use-a-hydrometer" href="https://www.grainger.com/know-how/equipment-information/kh-product-guide-how-to-use-a-hydrometer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A hydrometer</a> is a tool that looks like a test tube and is used to measure the specific gravity of a liquid. In this case, we're going to use it to measure the specific gravity of battery acid. This will tell us how much charge is left in our battery.</p>
<p>To do this, simply remove the caps from the top of your battery and use the hydrometer to suck up some of the acid from each cell. Make sure you're not getting any of the sediment or gunk that will be floating on top since this can throw off your readings.</p>
<p>Once you've taken a reading from each cell, add them all together and then divide by the total number of cells to get an average specific gravity. </p>
<p>If your hydrometer doesn't have a scale on it, then you can use this formula:</p>
<p>Average Specific Gravity = (Total Mass Of Acid / Total Volume Of Acid) x 1000</p>
<p>For example, if there are five cells and the total mass of acid in them is 12 grams with a total volume of 14 mL then the average specific gravity would be:</p>
<p>Average Specific Gravity = (12 / 14) x 1000</p>
<p>= 850 g/mL</p>
<p>This tells us that there's about 85% charge left in our battery. If you'd like to know what percentage your battery has charged, then use this formula: </p>
<p>Percentage Charged = (Average Specific Gravity - Minimum Specific Gravity)/(Maximum Specific Gravity - Minimum Specific Gravity) x 100%</p>
<p>For example, if the average specific gravity of our battery was 850 g/mL and its minimum specific gravity is 800 g/mL while its maximum specific gravity is 1000 g/mL then the percentage charged would be calculated as follows: </p>
<p>Percentage Charged = (850 - 800) / (1000 - 800) x 100%</p>
<p>= 50%</p>
<p>So, our battery is about halfway charged.</p>
<h2>Testing Lithium-Ion Batteries </h2>
<p>For lithium-ion batteries, check for any signs of bulging or leaking electrolyte solution around the terminals or exterior casing. If there are no signs of these issues, then your battery is probably in okay condition.</p>
<p>If you do notice any bulging or leaking electrolyte solution around the terminals or exterior casing don't test it. This indicates that your lithium-ion battery has reached its end-of-life and should be replaced with a new one.</p>
<p>In a similar way to testing lead-acid batteries, the main two ways to test lithium batteries are cycling and charge/discharge testing under high load conditions.</p>
<h3>How To Conduct Cycling Tests On Lithium-Ion Batteries </h3>
<p>To perform cycling tests on lithium-ion batteries is similar to the method we've described for lead ion batteries but with a few important differences.</p>
<p>Firstly, lithium-ion batteries don't have memory effects so there's no need to perform any full cycling tests to reboot your battery back into its initial optimal state.</p>
<p>Secondly, due to the nature of lithium-ion batteries, they can overheat and catch fire if they are not handled properly.</p>
<p>This is because lithium-ion batteries use a liquid electrolyte solution instead of the solid lead plates that make up lead-acid batteries. That means there's nothing to prevent them from overheating.</p>
<p>As such, always be cautious when handling and testing lithium-ion batteries. Be careful to avoid any instances where they might overheat and catch fire.</p>
<h3>How To Conduct Charge/Discharge Tests On Lithium-Ion Batteries</h3>
<p>Charge/discharge tests are the most common way to test lithium-ion batteries. They allow you to see how well the battery performs under high load conditions. It's also much safer and won't lead to battery fatigue.</p>
<p>To do this, connect your battery to a charger that can provide a constant current and then measure the voltage of the battery as it charges.</p>
<p>Once the battery has reached its maximum voltage (which is usually around four volts), disconnect it from the charger and measure the voltage again.</p>
<p>Take into account that your battery's resting voltage will be different depending on its temperature. You'll need to use a temperature sensor to get accurate readings.</p>
<p>Then, discharge the battery by connecting it to a load that will draw a constant current until the battery voltage reaches its minimum (usually around two volts). </p>
<p>Again, take into account the battery's temperature when discharging as this will affect the voltage readings.</p>
<p>Once you've completed these steps, you'll be able to see how well your battery performs under high load conditions.</p>
<p>This is a guide on how to understand and test batteries in accordance with international battery standards. If you're looking for more detailed information or want to know how to specifically test car batteries, then please consult the relevant standard documents. </p>
<p>Every year hundreds of lithium-ion battery fires occur. Don't become part of that statistic.</p>
